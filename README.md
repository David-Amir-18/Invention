## About

- Superwaver Invention

## üí°Introduction
- Ultrasounds are being increasingly used in diagnostic imaging, owing to the relatively non
invasive nature and ability to capture real-time images of soft tissues. But today‚Äôs ultrasound 
systems tend to have a low resolution in the high depth ranges, so they cannot identify small or 
subtle abnormalities. This proposal details a device that has been designed to help improve the 
resolution for ultrasonic images no matter the depth.


## üèÅ Project Overview
- Our device aims to break The Attenuation-Depth-Frequency Trade-Off law which is based on the 
Law of Conservation of Energy. By sending a wave, we call (Super Wave) that can regenerate its 
energy, leading to no attenuation whatsoever.  
We believe the images will be of great quality. This device interface with existing ultrasound 
machines, eliminating the need for expensive system upgrades and providing high-resolution 
images. 

## üìå GOALS & BENEFITS 
- With better images, doctors can now diagnose things much earlier and more accurately than ever. This is 
especially true for heart, baby and cancer conditions. 
Clearer imaging quality may enhance patient trust and understanding of potential outcomes with regard to 
their diagnosis. 
Affordable Option: This device enhances current systems instead of replacing them allowing for a cheap 
way to upgrade the ultrasound.
